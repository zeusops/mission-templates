# Load screens

This directory contains load screens created by S. Holm. To use the images,
copy an image of your choice into `missionfolder/files` and change the
`loadScreen` variable in `description.ext` to match the new file name. Remember
to delete the default load screen image (`ZEUSOPS_TAKISTAN.jpg`) to keep the
mission file size down.
